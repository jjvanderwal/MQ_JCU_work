21.03.13 EMG: Linda, Abby, there are several ways of connecting to the HPC, the easiest is with an 
  ssh client (e.g., Putty): Enter the host name 'zodiac.hpc.jcu.edu.au' which will prompt for userid and password
  (from JJV). Since you're not on the JCU network, you'll also need to enter '8822' as the port.
